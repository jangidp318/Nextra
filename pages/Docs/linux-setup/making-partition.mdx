Step 2: Shrink Volume

    - In order to partition a hard disk in Windows 11, you must first reduce the size of the disk. To do this, right-click the disk you have chosen – in this case, the Windows disk will be the main partition – and then click **Shrink Volume**.
    - In the following dialog box, you can specify how much space the new partition should have.
    - Enter **100GB (102400 MB)** and Press Enter.
